#Beijing's Urbanization Reflected in Apartment Layouts: A Computer Vision and Isovist Analysis (1970-2020)
This repository contains the data and code for the analysis of Beijing's urbanization as reflected in apartment layouts, using a computer vision and isovist approach. The study period spans from 1970 to 2020.

#Code
#The code for this study is written in Python and utilizes the following libraries:
OpenCV
YOLOv8
VGG16

#Results
The results of this study show that there has been a significant shift in the design of apartments in Beijing over the past five decades. This shift is likely due to a combination of factors, including the housing reform policies implemented in the 1990s and the changing lifestyle preferences of urban residents.
